##### 10 Product Backlog Items
* See trello for details - * [Trello link for product backlog](https://trello.com/b/EE5wZaYY/product-backlog)

##### Excellent User Stories
* See trello for details - * [Trello link for product backlog](https://trello.com/b/EE5wZaYY/product-backlog)

##### Ordered Backlog Rationale
We considered a few approaches for ordering Product Backlog Items (PBI) including the 20/20 vision game, dot voting (dotmocracy) and the decider protocol. We chose to use the decider protocol as a team. 

We started by classifying our stories into three buckets. They were “authentication” for features that related to application access, “commons” for common features including building blocks, and “Core Protocols” for features that enabled us to empower remote teams to implement the Core Protocols. This classification allowed us to identify the PBIs that belonged to the Minimal Viable Product (MVP).

The authentication features included the basic building blocks of web applications such as user sign up using email and social media, user sign in / sign out, and a mechanism to retrieve forgotten passwords. 

The common features included dashboard, email notification system, team creation, the addition of team members to a team, and the creation of sessions for a team.

The crux of the open source product are the Core Protocols features. This included the Check-In, Check-Out, and Passer protocols. Future implementations will include other Core Protocols.

With the classification of features complete, we looked at each bucket. We determined the order within each of the three buckets by using the concept of “Dependencies.” The more advanced features were dependent on the building blocks. 

With the dependent features ordered appropriately within each of the three buckets and a clear picture of the Product Backlog, we were able to complete the ordering process by using the decider protocol. The product owner, Nicholas Ruta, stated “I propose that we order the three buckets by putting authentication first, commons second and core protocols third so that the building blocks are in place before we implement the crux of the product. 1…2…3.” The other members of the team showed positive visual acceptance and the ordering of the product backlog was complete.


##### Backlog estimating and Sprint Planning

##### Estimation of PBIs 
* Completed estimation of PBIs, See trello for details - * [Trello link for product backlog](https://trello.com/b/EE5wZaYY/product-backlog)


##### Estimation of PBIs in story points
* We used the poker cards from class and the wideband delphi process. On Trello, we used the scrum plugin to show the points for each story. 
* See trello for details - * [Trello link for product backlog](https://trello.com/b/EE5wZaYY/product-backlog)
* [See this link for the points in detail](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T1K0D9MU5-F1LR5BZ55/pointestimationprocess.png)

##### Whole team relative size estimating activity
* Pointing Poker Session

##### Only Development Team members participated in creating the estimates.
* The Scrum Master Vasu Swamidurai facilitated an estimation session in which the developers, Brian Feeny, Truman Ta, Christian Schlubach, Oyin Shenbanjo, did the point estimations. The product owner, Nicholas Ruta, was available to answer any questions about the stories during the estimation process. 

##### Forecast of story points that our team can complete during the sprint
* 90 points

##### Forecast rationale
* The forecast was based on the skillsets of the team members, the complexity of the project and the limited time availability of the team members. 
* The process of setting up the initial environment offered us a baseline metric to determine the overall workload.

##### Sprint Backlog
* [See this link for the sprint backlog](https://trello.com/b/EE5wZaYY/product-backlog)
* We pulled stories into our spring backlog and still have a few items left in our product backlog.
* Our forecast is 90 points and our aggregate size is 85 points for the first sprint.
* The Scrum Master Vasu Swamidurai facilitated the sprint planning in which the developers, Brian Feeny, Truman Ta, Christian Schlubach, Oyin Shenbanjo, did the decomposition of stories into tasks. The product owner, Nicholas Ruta, was available to answer any questions about the stories during the sprint planning session.
* Our maximum story point is 13 points which is less than half of the forecasted velocity. 
* We broke down several larger PBIs into smaller stories.
* Stories are decomposed into tasks and are listed on the sprint backlog.
* Our sprint backlog is represented as a kanban board. [See this link for the kanban sprint backlog](https://trello.com/b/EE5wZaYY/product-backlog)


##### Burndown Chart
* [See this link for the burndown chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g1FkffUGeN-xQQcEt1gQs_WUYnAhA_Q2_Pc9k8h8XLU/edit#gid=1685512752)
* We have a sprint burndown chart. On the x-axis, we display time markers in units of 1 day. On the y-axis, we display story points remaining to get done. There is a linear curve descending from left to right; the leftmost point of the curve is number of story points in our sprint at sprint day 1; the rightmost point is 0 story points remaining on the last day of the sprint.

##### Continue sprinting - 07/07/16


##### What did you do in the last 24 hours that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal? Annotate your team's response so it's clear which team members did which activities.

* <strong>Vasu - [Team Member Checkin, Checkout, Passer] - </strong> Did pair programming with Christian and completed the test and implementation of CRUD Module of Team member Checkin, Checkout and Passer stories. 
* <strong>Truman -  [Product Branding] - </strong>Pair Programmed with Brian using TDD.  Updated UI Pages for Landing.html, Dashboard.html, SignIn.html, SignUp, html. Pair Programmed with Oyin. HTML/CSS
* <strong>Brian -	</strong>Wrote tests for all features, pair programmed with Truman to troubleshoot some issues.
* <strong>Nick -  [User Sign-Up][Product Branding] - </strong>I wrote the form validation logic for the user sign up form using the parsley javascript library. I improved the product branding by modifying the HTML/CSS layout for the dashboard.
* <strong>Oyin - [Product Branding, Team Member Checkin, Checkout, CI/CD]</strong> Improved the functionality and design on the dashboard.html page where team members can check-in, check-out, and check stats of a session. Made some bug fixes. Configured drone.io and worked on getting it’s functionality.
* <strong>Christian - [Team Member Checkin, Checkout, Passer]</strong> Vasu and I wrote code that wired check in, pass, and checkout to the models. We also worked together to write tests for the models and views to increase our code coverage. 



##### What will you do in the next 24 hours to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal? Annotate your team's response so it's clear which team members plan to do which activities.

* <strong>Vasu - [Team Member Checkin, Checkout, Passer] - </strong> Implement event handlers for emotion buttons. Clean up the code and final testing.
* <strong>Truman -  [Product Branding] - </strong> Continue testing and debugging.  Prepare for demonstration.
* <strong>Brian -	</strong>Write more unit tests and add code coverage reports, pair programming 
* <strong>Nick - [Product Branding] - </strong> I will use pair programming with Oyin to complete the dashboard HTML/CSS UI tasks for the stats feature. 
* <strong>Oyin - [Product Branding]</strong> Work with Nick and Truman on any final improvements to the dashboard and begin demo preparation.
* <strong>Christian - </strong>  Final testing and presentation preparation/review.


##### Do you see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal? What are the impediments? What is your impediment removal plan?
* <strong>Vasu</strong> - 
	<strong>Impediment:</strong> Continuous Delivery implementation is challenging when learning a new application framework (Django)
	<strong>Removal:</strong> I found drone.io and studied it enough to use it for our CD system.  
* <strong>Truman</strong> - no impediments. 
* <strong>Brian</strong> - 
<strong>Impediment:</strong> We needed a front end testing suite and nobody was familiar with one. 
<strong>Removal:</strong>  I spent time to learn and implement front end testing using Selenium.
* <strong>Nick</strong> - 
<strong>Impediment:</strong> The javascript related plugins of bootstrap are not currently configured and may be tricky to set up.
<strong>Removal:</strong> Installation of additional libraries after reviewing the related bootstrap documentation. 
* <strong>Oyin -</strong>  <strong>Impediment:</strong> Had trouble using Heroku to pair with drone.io for CD. 
<strong>Removal:</strong> Vasu helped find another solution by using SSH to connect to DigitalOcean for CD instead.
* <strong>Christian -</strong> 
	<strong>Impediment:</strong> The team is not familiar with our software stack.
	<strong>Removal:</strong> I offered training to the team in order to familiarize them with Django and front end integration.

##### We have a Continuous Integration system running. The CI system automatically builds our code every time we merge to master. The CI system executes our unit tests every time it builds the code.
* For continuous integration (CI), we have hooked up our github repository to an online saas CI provider, drone.io. 
* Drone is configured to listen for commits on the repo and will trigger a build of the application which includes running all of the unit test cases and code coverage.
* If any test fails, feedback would be provided to the development team to fix the tests. 
* If all tests pass, then the tool will create the deployable artifact.

<img src="https://github.com/apsvasudevan/agile6/blob/master/ci_3.png?raw=true"/>


##### We have a Continuous Deployment system running. The CD system deploys our software to a production-like environment. The CD system executes additional tests of our software in the production-like environment. The CD system deploys our software to a live production environment. our live production environment works properly.
* Drone.io is used for the continuous deployment. It is hooked up with the teamspirit.grav.io server on the digital ocean cloud provider.
* On a successful build of the artifact in the CI step, the artifact will be deployed immediately to the server thus achieving continuous delivery with high quality. 
* [See this link to view our live production site in action](http://teamspirit.grav.io/)
