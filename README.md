##### Product Backlog

##### 10 Product Backlog Items

##### Excellent User Stories

##### Ordered Backlog Rationale
We considered a few approaches for ordering Product Backlog Items (PBI) including the 20/20 vision game, dot voting (dotmocracy) and the decider protocol. We chose to use the decider protocol as a team. 

We started by classifying our stories into three buckets. They were “authentication” for features that related to application access, “commons” for common features including building blocks, and “Core Protocols” for features that enabled us to empower remote teams to implement the Core Protocols. This classification allowed us to identify the PBIs that belonged to the Minimal Viable Product (MVP).

The authentication features included the basic building blocks of web applications such as user sign up using email and social media, user sign in / sign out, and a mechanism to retrieve forgotten passwords. 

The common features included dashboard, email notification system, team creation, the addition of team members to a team, and the creation of sessions for a team.

The crux of the open source product are the Core Protocols features. This included the Check-In, Check-Out, and Passer protocols. Future implementations will include other Core Protocols.

With the classification of features complete, we looked at each bucket. We determined the order within each of the three buckets by using the concept of “Dependencies.” The more advanced features were dependent on the building blocks. 

With the dependent features ordered appropriately within each of the three buckets and a clear picture of the Product Backlog, we were able to complete the ordering process by using the decider protocol. The product owner, Nicholas Ruta, stated “I propose that we order the three buckets by putting authentication first, commons second and core protocols third so that the building blocks are in place before we implement the crux of the product. 1…2…3.” The other members of the team showed positive visual acceptance and the ordering of the product backlog was complete.


##### Backlog estimating and Sprint Planning

##### Estimation of PBIs 
* Completed estimation of PBIs, See trello for details - * [Trello link for product backlog](https://trello.com/b/EE5wZaYY/product-backlog)


##### Estimation of PBIs in story points
* We used the poker cards from class and the wideband delphi process. On Trello, we used the scrum plugin to show the points for each story. 
* See trello for details - * [Trello link for product backlog](https://trello.com/b/EE5wZaYY/product-backlog)
* [See this link for the points in detail](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T1K0D9MU5-F1LR5BZ55/pointestimationprocess.png)

##### Whole team relative size estimating activity
* Pointing Poker Session

##### Only Development Team members participated in creating the estimates.
* The Scrum Master Vasu Swamidurai facilitated an estimation session in which the developers, Brian Feeny, Truman Ta, Christian Schlubach, Oyin Shenbanjo, did the point estimations. The product owner, Nicholas Ruta, was available to answer any questions about the stories during the estimation process. 

##### Forecast of story points that our team can complete during the sprint
* 90 points

##### Forecast rationale
* The forecast was based on the skillsets of the team members, the complexity of the project and the limited time availability of the team members. 
* The process of setting up the initial environment offered us a baseline metric to determine the overall workload.

##### Sprint Backlog
* [See this link for the sprint backlog](https://trello.com/b/EE5wZaYY/product-backlog)
* We pulled stories into our spring backlog and still have a few items left in our product backlog.
* Our forecast is 90 points and our aggregate size is 85 points for the first sprint.
* The Scrum Master Vasu Swamidurai facilitated the sprint planning in which the developers, Brian Feeny, Truman Ta, Christian Schlubach, Oyin Shenbanjo, did the decomposition of stories into tasks. The product owner, Nicholas Ruta, was available to answer any questions about the stories during the sprint planning session.
* Our maximum story point is 13 points which is less than half of the forecasted velocity. 
* We broke down several larger PBIs into smaller stories.
* Stories are decomposed into tasks and are listed on the sprint backlog.
* Our sprint backlog is represented as a kanban board. [See this link for the kanban sprint backlog](https://trello.com/b/EE5wZaYY/product-backlog)


##### Burndown Chart
* [See this link for the burndown chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g1FkffUGeN-xQQcEt1gQs_WUYnAhA_Q2_Pc9k8h8XLU/edit#gid=1685512752)
* We have a sprint burndown chart. On the x-axis, we display time markers in units of 1 day. On the y-axis, we display story points remaining to get done. There is a linear curve descending from left to right; the leftmost point of the curve is number of story points in our sprint at sprint day 1; the rightmost point is 0 story points remaining on the last day of the sprint.


##### Start sprinting


##### Updated Sprint Backlog task board and burndown chart.

##### Evidence that we are building our product test-first. Here are at least 10 unit tests in our test suite. They all pass.

The tests files for our project can be view on github at - [See this link for the tests file](https://github.com/apsvasudevan/agile6/tree/master/coreprotocols/teamspirit/tests)

* Here is proof of the 10+ unit tests currently in our suite -
